--------- THE FIRST TREE ASSETS ---------

You're free to use these sounds (and one dog biscuit box) in your project how you see fit (CC BY 3.0 license for my stuff). Most of the assets in my game were purchased on the Unity Asset Store and modified, and I can't redistribute those. So if you're looking for the main asset packs I used, check these links out:
